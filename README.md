# SBB_Chamber
## This is a 3D printable file for a modified 4 Well chamber which facilitates Sudan Black B assays in tissue slices.

The modified chamber provides two main advantages:
- Enhances efficiency of the assay by reducing the chances of loosing sample slices due to the opacity of the liquid or careless handling
- Allows the experiment to be run on multiple slices simultaneously without dramatically increasing the time of the assay
- Achieves an important reduction on antibody usage
- Permits to expose the tissue slices to a homogeneous antibody mixture which in turn improves control reproducibility

To properly use the chamber, you should:
1. Place a net (such as nylon thights) tightly covering the bottom of the 4 well chamber
2. Secure the net in place with a rubber band placed around the latteral grouve
3. Make sure the net wont fall loose when soaked in liquid to avoid slices swapping around wells
4. If necesary, secure the net further by piercing it with a pin
5. Check the chamber fits tight but with no difficulty into the solution tray
6. Prepare the materials for your assay (tissue slices, ethanol, SSB solution, timer, etc.)

If printed in ABS, the chamber and the solution tray can be cleaned with ethanol. If further cleaning is needed, use *water but no detergents* (to avoid any interference with antibodies).

## Find a bug?
If you found an issue or would like to submit an improvement to this project, please submit an issue using the issues tab above.

## Known issues (Work in progress)
Depending on the net, the weight of the wet net could get it to loosen and allow tissue slices to swap between wells (which is a really bad thing to happen). This can easily be fixed manually by using pins to secure it, or using more light or resistant nets. However it would be nice to come up with a modified 3D printable without this problem out of the box
